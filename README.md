# Pokedex-App
A Pokedex Application I made with Node & Express using the [Pokeapi](https://github.com/PokeAPI) api.

## Features
* Pokemon Search
  * Type in the name of any pokemon or even part of one to get a list of pokemon that match your query.
  * You can even search for Mega Pokemon! (this is currently the only way to view Mega Pokemon)
* View All Pokemon
  * By leaving out a search query, you can view all pokemon currently in the api. currently its set up to show 25 pokemon per page
  but eventually you'll be able to set your own increments (10, 15, 25, 50, 100, etc)
* Dynamic Pokemon Cries
  * Each pokemon (barring a couple, mostly just megas and non-standard formes) has its own cry that can be played by pressing the cry button on the pokemon's page.
 Some don't work for reasons I can't really say, but in the future I'll look into incorperating fallbacks.

It can be seen in action [here](https://serene-chamber-30456.herokuapp.com/) On Heroku!
It's about halfway done.
